    <pre><a href="RectangleClass.html">1. Make a Rectangle class that stores a width and a height. Make a few instances and print out the
        properties. Modify a few of the properties and print out the results again.</a>

    <pre><a href="getArea.html">2. Add a getArea method. Use the prototype property.</a> </pre>

    <pre><a href="RectangleConstructor.html">3. Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output
        20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for,
        it probably is the answer I am looking for.)</a>
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(4, 5);
        r.hieght = 50;
        r.getArea(); --> 20 // Not 200

    <pre><a href="Object.html">4. Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but don’t define
        a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name. It seems
        very odd to Java programmers to make an object without first defining a class, but JavaScript programmers do this sort of thing all the time</a>
    </pre>

    <pre><a href="MiddleNameProperty.html">5. Try reading the middleName property from your variable above. Try assigning to the middleName
        property. Try reading the property again after you assign to it. Is this behavior a good thing or a bad
        thing?</a> 
    </pre>

    <pre><a href="String.html">6. Create a string that contains what looks like an object with firstName and lastName properties. Use
        “eval” to turn it into a real object, and test it the same way you did with the previous object that you
        created directly.</a>

    <pre><a href="json.html">7. Do the same with JSON.parse. You have to follow strict JSON rules in this case.</a> </pre>

    <pre><a href="GlobalPrint.html">1. Write a JS program to create object of person with fields as follows:-</a>

        common properties from amitabh, try to use it such common properties from amitabh instead of
        creating it in abhishek.</a>

    <pre><a href="ObjectOfAradhya.html">3. Modify the above code to create third object as "Aaradhya", this object shares the common

    <pre><a href="BankAccount.html">4. Create a JS program to implement below:-</a>
        BankAccount
       |(accountNumber)
       |(accountHolderName)
       |(accountBalance)
       -------------------------
       | |
       Savings Current
        (isSalary) (odLimit)
       Now,
       create 1 object of savings with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and isSalary.
       create 1 object of currrent with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and odLimit.
       use savings account object to call a function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the
       accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below 0.
       use current account object to calla function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the
       accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below negative of odLimit.
       Now, call getCurrentBalance() from both the object, that will return the accountBalance of the object
       used to call this method.

        <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked.
            In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations 
            that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
            The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents,
            such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit,
            nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.
            Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings,
            and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

        <p>In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the term cup cake or cupcake.
            In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups,
            ramekins, or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in. This is the use of the name that has remained,
            and the name of "cupcake" is now given to any small, round cake that is about the size of a teacup.
            While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcake, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely 
            topped with elaborate icing.

        <p>Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
           It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice,
           such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate
           air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
           The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F).
           It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

        <p>A doughnut or donut (the latter spelling often seen in American English) is a type of fried dough confection or dessert 
            food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade 
            or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.
            Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or a number of 
            shapes without a hole, and often filled, but can also be ball-shaped ("doughnut holes").
             Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings and flavorings are used for different types,
              such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, 
              oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors
